I made this project to practice Python and Flask framework.


What this program does:

after user types a name in the url bar, 
it sends a request to 'genderize.io' and gets back data.
Then it prints the result (gender of a name with a calculated probability).
Minimum CSS is used for styling, to practice Python + Flask + CSS.


Flask rules:

.css and .js files must be inside the 'static' folder
.html files must be inside the 'templates' folder
